### Privacy by Design Foundation

<img src="/images/pbd.png" style="float: right; width: 40%; padding: 15px" />

The Privacy by Design Foundation creates and maintains free and open source software in which the privacy of the user is the most important. The most important application of the foundation is the identity platform [IRMA](/irma-en), an acronym of I Reveal my Attributes. The foundation also aims to generally improve the development and usage of open, privacy-friendly and well secured ICT.

With IRMA you can disclose properties (attributes) of yourself in a privacy-friendly and secure way - for example, I am over 18 years old - without disclosing other, non-relevant information about yourself. Using such attributes you can authenticate yourself to for example login on a website.

Additionally, with IRMA you can create attribute-based signatures, see [IRMA in detail](/irma-explanation) for more information.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The foundation has two important operational roles in IRMA:</p>

1. Development and supporting the [IRMA
software](http://github.com/privacybydesign).
2. Supporting infrastructure for issuing attributes.

#### Collaborations

The Privacy by Design foundation was set-up in 2016. It arose from the [Digital Security](http://www.ru.nl/ds/) research group of the Radboud University and from the Privacy and Identity Lab [PI.lab](http://www.pilab.nl).  The foundation is an independent non-profit spin-off.

The foundation welcomes collaboration with others to get IRMA up and
running.  Pilots are now being prepared with the help of a number of
other parties, among which:

 * The [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/), for (strong)
   authentication of student and employees and for digital signing of,
   e.g., examination grades.

 * [SURFnet](https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/surfconext/index.html),
   for issuing and verifying of attributes through SURFconext.

 * [Nuts](https://nuts.nl), for an open infrastructure in healthcare,
   see also the portal for medical doctors
   [Helder](https://helder.health/) with
   [logon](https://helder.health/logon) via IRMA.

 * [Alliander](http://www.alliander.nl), for authentication and
   signing within the context of `smart' homes. In addition, the
   foundation is structurally supported by Alliander.

 * [Open University](https://www.ou.nl/en/home), for joint IRMA
   software development.

The foundation receives external funding via the following projects.

 * *Connecting (with) IRMA* (2018), via the [SIDNfonds](https://www.sidnfonds.nl/projecten), see in particular this [project page](https://www.sidnfonds.nl/projecten/connecting-with-irma).

 * *Citizen Science* (2018-2020), via the European Regional
    Development Fund [ERDF](http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/funding/erdf/); see the [ERDF projecten in the province of Gelderland](https://www.europaomdehoek.nl/projecten/?radius=&projectProvince[]=Gelderland).

* *Chronical Pain* (2018-2020), via the European Regional
    Development Fund [ERDF](http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/funding/erdf/), see [ERDF projecten in the province of Gelderland](https://www.europaomdehoek.nl/projecten/?radius=&projectProvince[]=Gelderland).
