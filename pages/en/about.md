More in particular, the foundation focuses on the development, roll
out, and actual usage of its own identity wallet [Yivi](/irma-en), 
formerly known as IRMA. With Yivi people can prove
in a privacy-friendly and secure manner various personal properties
(attributes) about themselves (such as: I'm older than 18), without
revealing any other non-relevant information. Via such attributes you
can *authenticate* yourself, for instance in order to log into a
webpage.

In addition, Yivi allows its users to create attribute-based digital
signature, see [Yivi](/irma-explanation) for more information.
