You can add multiple e-mail addresses as attributes in your IRMA app,
for instance your business address and your private address.

When you registered your IRMA app, you may have provided an email
address already, which is associated with your [MyIRMA](/myirma)
account. This e-mail address has been issued as (first) attribute in
your IRMA app.

As a first step of the issuance process of an e-mail address, you
provide your e-mail address in a textfield. A verification e-mail
message is then sent to this address, containing a link. When you
follow that link, the e-mail address will be issued to you, as IRMA
attribute.

(It appears that in some email clients on mobile phones this link is
not properly "clickable". In that case you can try to copy the link
yourself into a web-browser. Alternatively, you can read this e-mail on
another device, such as a laptop or PC. It is being investigated how
to best solve this problem.)

The validity period of this e-mail address attribute is *one year*.

Immediately after issuance, the foundation removes this e-mail
attribute from its own systems. The foundation does not keep a log of
issuance.
