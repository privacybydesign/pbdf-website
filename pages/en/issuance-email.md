You can add multiple e-mail addresses as attributes in your IRMA app,
for instance your business address and your private address.

As a first step of the issuance process of an e-mail address, you
provide your e-mail address in a textfield. A verification e-mail
message is then sent to this address, containing a link. When you
follow that link, the e-mail address will be issued to you, as IRMA
attribute.

(It appears that in some email clients on mobile phones this link is
not properly "clickable". In that case you can try to copy the link
yourself into a web-browser. Alternatively, you can read this e-mail on
another device, such as a laptop or PC. It is being investigated how
to best solve this problem.)

The validity period of this e-mail address attribute is *one year*.

**Note:**
As of November 30th, 2020, the issuance of e-mail attributes is no longer
handled by the Privacy by Design foundation, but rather by
[SIDN](https://www.sidn.nl/en).

After issuance, SIDN removes the e-mail address from its systems.
Regarding maintenance and monitoring, SIDN does keep a log of the issuance,
however this log is automatically removed and does not include the e-mail address.
