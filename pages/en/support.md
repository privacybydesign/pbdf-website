The Privacy by Design foundation does not wish to monopolize and sees
the development of the identity platform IRMA as a *community effort*
with possible involvement, cooperation and support from different
sides and in different ways. Below more information is given about two
such contributions (*in kind* en *in cash*). For other possible
contributions please get [in touch](/contact-en).

### Contribute to software development

If you, as individual or organization, wish to contribute to further
development of IRMA software, please contact the *lead developer*
Sietse Ringers (s.ringers 'at' privacybydesign.foundation).
Contributions are welcome, for instance, for integration of IRMA
authentication and signing in existing software packages, such as for
communication and text processing. For instance, it would be very nice
to have plugins for checking IRMA signatures in various mail clients
or office environments. The foundation hopes that such software will
become freely available, as open source. However, it is also possible
to build commercial and/or closed source software on top of the
(free) IRMA infrastructure.

### Contribute financially

The Privacy by Design foundation wishes to offer as many of its
services as possible for free. However, the activities of the
foundation do cost money, for instance, in order to keep the IRMA
infrastructure up and running and to develop and maintain new services
and software (among which, in particular, the [IRMA
app](/download/)).

The Privacy by Design foundation is a non-for-profit organization.
But it does need funding for its activities. This is where you can
help, certainly if you appreciate the foundation's activities.

The foundation awards the special status *Friend of the Foundation* or
*Hero of the Foundation* to companies and other organizations, or
private citizens, that support the foundation with at least
ten thousand Euro (friends) or hundred thousand Euro (heroes).

When you are interested in becoming a friend or hero of the
foundation, please contact the chairman of the foundation (voorzitter
'at' privacybydesign.foundation). Possible reasons for supporting the
foundation are:

* You value the development of a non-commercial open source identity
  platform that can be used by anyone.
* You are a (current or future) user of IRMA and would like the
  foundation to be (financially) sufficiently stable so that it can
  continue its activities in the long run.

Friend/hero-ship of the foundation does not give any policy influence:
the foundation is and remains independent. The foundation will, if
needed, support its friends and heroes first when operational problems
arise. Financial contributions will be spent only in line with the
[goals](/about/) of the foundation.
The foundation publishes a year report containing a financial
statement.
