In the [Dutch Civil
Registry](https://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/voorzieningen/gegevens/inhoud-basisregistraties/inhoud-brp/)
the Dutch government keeps track of data of all people living in The
Netherlands. Every Dutch city has access to the Civil Registry in
order to service citizens. Cities not only have access to data of its
own citizens, but also to that of other cities.

The city of [Nijmegen](https://www.nijmegen.nl) issues IRMA attributes
from the Civil Registry. This service is available to everyone
registered in the Civil Registry that can login with
[DigiD](https://www.digid.nl/en/).

The following attributes are issued:

 * initials
 * family name
 * birth date
 * age limits (above 12, 16, 18, 21 or 65)
 * sex
 * address
 * zip code
 * city
 * Burger Service Number (BSN).

The attributes are digitally signed by the city of Nijmegen. The
Privacy by Design Foundation is not involved in this process.

The validity of these attributes are currently *three
months*. Eventually the issuance of these attributes will also be done
by other cities, separately or jointly.

**Warning.** The BSN attribute is legally only allowed to be used by
organizations that have legal grounds to process it. For every other
use asking for the BSN attributes is illegal; see the
[information](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/privacy-en-persoonsgegevens/vraag-en-antwoord/welke-organisaties-mogen-mijn-burgerservicenummer-bsn-gebruiken)
(in Dutch) from the Dutch national government.
