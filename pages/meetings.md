### Earlier IRMA meeting: Friday, Nov. 3, 10:00 - 13:00, 2017.

**Programme:**

   1. 10.00 - 10:30 Oscar Koeroo (KPN information security office).
      "Security for Remote SIM Provisioning for e-SIM"

      Abstract: Traditionally phones use SIM cards to authenticate
      subscribers to the mobile network. The SIM cards contain
      information about the home network and several authentication
      keys of the mobile network and the subscriber. Manufacturers are
      miniaturising the SIM cards to reduce costs and aid
      applicability in Phones and accessories. The step beyond the
      nano-SIM card form-factor is the complete removal of the SIM
      card itself and replacing it with an e-SIM, or embedded
      SIM. With this embedded SIM mobile network operators can load
      the same SIM card information dynamically into a phone. This
      opens up a new attack surface, by virtue of new components in
      mobile devices, new provisioning protocol as alternative to the
      physical SIM card. It also has geo-political implications,
      depending upon the trust model. And depending upon the
      architecture and assuming we also include IoT with e-SIMs it
      could also introduce a new business continuity risk to 60B
      devices globally, as per prospect of the adoption of this
      technology in the foreseeable future.

   2. 10:30 - 11:00 Pim Vullers (NXP).  "IRMA prototype on a NXP
      SmartMX3 P71 smart card"

   5. 12:00 - 12:15 Stijn Meijer (Radboud University en ING)
